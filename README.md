## 🔒 Privacy

Husk is designed with privacy as a top priority. All your data stays private and secure:

- **Offline-first:** Husk operates fully offline when using Ollama, so your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to sync.
- **Optional iCloud Sync:** You can opt in to sync your chat history securely via iCloud, protected by Apple’s end-to-end encryption.
- **No data collection:** Husk does not collect or transmit any personal data to third parties.
- **API key support:** When using external APIs (coming soon), your API keys and data are handled securely and only sent to the respective providers.

Your privacy and control over your data are fundamental principles behind Husk.
